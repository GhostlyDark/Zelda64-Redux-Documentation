# Zelda64-Redux-Documentation by ShadowOne333

The documentation listed in this repository is merely for research and educational purposes.

Any files listed in any of the text has been ignored from the repository, but following the documentation, they can be reproduced, as most changes listed in each of the .txt files can be obtained from other Majora's Mask/Ocarina of Time ROMs.

The documentation was done to keep track of each and every change made as a continuation to both MM and OoT Redux hacks started by Maroc at Romhacking.net
