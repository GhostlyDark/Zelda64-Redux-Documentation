# Zelda64-Redux-Documentation by ShadowOne333

The documentation listed in this repository is merely for research and educational purposes.

Following the documentation, the majority of the files and assets that can be found here can be reproduced, as most changes listed in each of the .txt files can be obtained from other Majora's Mask/Ocarina of Time ROMs. Only assets which cannot be reproduced are specified in the .txt files, or specific new assets (like new Deku Pipes, new Troupe Leader Mask item name, MQ title screen, etc.)

The documentation was done to keep track of each and every change made as a continuation to both MM and OoT Redux hacks started by Maroc at Romhacking.net
