# Zelda64 Redux Documentation (by ShadowOne333)

The documentation listed in this repository is merely for research and educational purposes.

Following the documentation, the majority of the files and assets that can be found here can be reproduced, as most changes listed in each of the .txt files can be obtained from other Majora's Mask/Ocarina of Time ROMs. 
The only assets which cannot be reproduced are either specifically mentioned in the .txt files; or those that are entirely new assets have been done by myself (unless specified), like new recoloured Deku Pipes (based on the original white Pipes from MM J v1.0), new Troupe Leader Mask item name, MQ title screen, recoloured Goron and Zora (courtesy of GarohMastah), fixed Romani Sign, etc.

The documentation was done to keep track of each and every change made as a continuation to both MM and OoT Redux hacks started by Maroc at Romhacking.net
