///*************	REDUX TEXT CHANGES	*************\\\


FOR IMPORTING ALL THE TEXT TYPO, BUGS, AND SOUND FX FIXES, PLEASE REFER TO THE "AREA TITLES SECTION.TXT"!!!

"Scroll of Majora" was used to create all the new text and other text fixes from subsequent releases of MM into USA v1.0 (based on TCRF page).
For control codes and other specific fixes, they were all done manually through Hex editing.

Both non-txt files located inside this folder are necessary to get the new Area Titles working properly. Refer to the "Area Titles.txt" file for the needed changes and instructions.

よくやった よ
コレで ゾーラの戦士の魂も
安心して 眠りにつけるじゃろ・・
ワシも古（いにしえ）のおきてに
したがい ふたたび
長い眠りに つかねばならん
じゃが、このあたりに ただよう
邪気は 完全には
消えたわけではなさそうじゃ


LITERAL TRANSLATION:

Well done
With this, the soul of Zola's warrior 
can sleep with peace of mind...

According to the old commandments, 
I have to go to sleep again 
for a long time, 
(but the wickedness around here 
seems not to have completely disappeared.)


ORIGINAL (0xA2A5B3):

Now I can continue resting in
peace. I too must abide the laws
of ancient times and again merely
watch from my deep slumber...


POSSIBLE RETRANSLATION:

Now the Zora Warrior's soul
can rest in peace...

I, too, must abide the laws
of ancient times, and have to
return again to my deep slumber...

今日、１番 知られたくない
ミカウに 全てを 知られて
しまいました
最初は はずかしくて 悲しくて
どうしようもなかったけど
その時 ミカウが いった言葉に
私の心は 救われた
思いがしました
だけど、ミカウ お願いだから
ムチャなことはしないで 


LITERAL TRANSLATION:

Today, Mikau, who I don't want 
to know, has known everything.

At first it was embarrassing and sad 
and I couldn't help it.

At that time, I thought that 
the words Mikau said saved my heart.

But Mikau, please don't do too much.


ORIGINAL (0xA29F0F):

Today, I told everything to Mikau,
the one person whom I didn't
want to know about it.

At first, I was too embarrassed
and too sad to do anything.

And with the words that Mikau
said at that moment, I felt that
all hope had been lost.

But please, Mikau, I'm begging you,
don't do anything rash.


POSSIBLE RETRANSLATION:

Today, Mikau, the one person 
whom I didn't want to know,
about it, found out everything.

But please, Mikau, I'm begging you,
don't do anything rash.

Please forgive my rudeness.

// Text bug and typo fixes
//------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the text typo or script changes listed here are not the final texts. "Scroll of Majora" made it possible to repoint the text without the hassle of doing it manually, so this allowed for much richer text to be introduced from subsequent releases and even Majora's Mask 3D.

//	Sound FX bugfixes / Missing SFX
//------------------------------------------------------------------

//-----	BEFORE BEGINNING -----\\

https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=24340.msg338115#msg338115

https://zelda64rus.ucoz.ru/forum/32-677-2#24369

There are certain texts that begin with a sound effect format code [1E XX XX]. These ones seem to have a bug in v1.0 where, if the starting words had a sound effect format code before the first word, the sound won't play. This is caused due to the 2x text speed implemented in MM, so some format codes for sounds don't play because of that 2x text speed of Majora's Mask. 

The culprit of the issue seems to be that, during the transition from Japanese to English, the [1F XX XX] control code (which handles delays before resuming text) broke compatibility with the [1E 00 00] control code.


WORKAROUND FIX FOR THIS ISSUE:
To fix the issue of the sounds not playing, we can do a workaround with the control codes.

For this, we will make use of the [0A] control code JUST before the sound control code is played (1E XX XX).
Let's take the "Ka-ching!" text as an example:

* Original
"Deposit mail here.[11][1F 00 0A]
[1E 28 4C][17]Ka-ching![18][19]"

* Workaround for it:
"Deposit mail here.[20 20][0A][11]
[1E 28 4C][17]Ka-ching![18][19]"


To explain it, I simply padded out the text row before it with a couple of spaces (20 in Hex), and then added the [0A] control code, which makes slows down the text afterwards. 0A acts as a null character.

It is recommended to use the [0A] at the end of the row before the text, as using it before the text itself will add a null character to the line.
