C625C8 - Ocarina text ID
C5D220 - Instrument texts IDs

Unused icons address (Yaz0):
Ocarina -> A36F0C
Fairy Ocarina -> A3936C
Slingshot -> A3B9BC !!!
Hookshot-> A3EDFC
Granny's Drink -> A4B49C !!!
Map (JP) -> A5095C (X)
Deity Sword -> A6192C
Unused Magic -> A655FC
Fishing Rod -> A66AEC


//-----		Instrument Icons	-----//

1) Replace Slingshot unused icon with the new Deku Pipes icon:
Import "Pipes Icon (Comp).yaz0" at
0xA3B9BC-0xA3C20C (Slingshot) OR 0xA4B49C-0xA4BC5C (Hylian Loach)
(Pad out with FFs if there are leftover bytes until the next "Yaz0" string in Hex)
Icon ID: 0B (For text formatting [44] in place of Fishing Rod)
NOTE: The text formatting control code [06 01 XX] doesn't have any entry that uses the Slingshot nor the Hylian Loach. Some custom assembly code for this might be needed to make any of the two appear in the text box. 
For this, we need to repoint the Fishing Rod to the new Deku Pipes, so the Pipes can now be used in the control code. Each of the pointers need to have 0x2FC added to the pointer. Example:
Deku Pipes actual location 0x4DAC in the yaz0 graphics file.
Pointer (0xA36C3C): 00 00 4A B0, + 02 FC = 4DAC

Change "Fishing Rod" item icon graphic for the new Deku Pipes for text box use ONLY. At 0xA36D80 :
00 02 FB E0 -> 00 00 4A B0

POSSIBLE NEW ICONS: 4A (Recovery Heart), 3A (Helix Sword), 44 (Fishing Rod), 01-06 (Rupees), 0F (Big Magic Jar)
NOTE: Fishing Rod icon was repointed for the text formatting.


2) Replace Blue Fire unused icon with the new Goron Drums icon:
Import "Drums Icon (Comp).yaz0" at
0xA44BFC - 0xA45665 (Pad out with FFs if there are leftover bytes until the next "Yaz0" string in Hex)
Icon ID: 1C (For text formatting [64])


3) Replace Hylian Loach unused icon with the new Zora Guitar icon:
Import "Guitar Icon Icon (Comp).yaz0" at
0xA4AAFC - 0xA4B495 (Pad out with FFs if there are leftover bytes until the next "Yaz0" string in Hex)
Icon ID: 26 (For text formatting [70])


//----- Instrument text graphics for Subscreen	-----//
// Pointers for compressed Yaz0 item_names start at 0xA2765C in v1.0 Decompressed. They are each 4 bytes in length, with the first pointer (00 00 00 00) referring to 0xA27844 ($00-Ocarina of Time), where the first yaz0 graphic begins. Yaz0 graphics start at 0xA27844 for the item names.


1) Replace 2nd Unused Japanese text (Slingshot, after Magic Beans text) with the new Deku Pipes text:
Import "Pipes Text (Comp).yaz0" at
0xA28AF4 - 0xA28CA3 (Pad out with FFs if there are leftover bytes until the next "Yaz0" string in Hex)

2) Replace 1st Unused Japanese text (Fairy Ocarina, after Light Arrows text) and repoint the Blue Fire graphics to the new Goron Drums text:
Import "Drums Text (Comp).yaz0" at
0xA28204 - 0xA28473 - (Pad out with FFs if there are leftover bytes until the next "Yaz0" string in Hex)
Change pointer for it too:
0xA27674: 00 00 09 C0 -> 00 00 2B A0 
0xA276D0: 00 00 2B A0 -> 00 00 09 C0

3) Replace 4th Unused Japanese text (Hylian Loach, after Chateau Romani text) with the new Zora Guitar text:
Import "Guitar Text (Comp).yaz0" at
0xA2B2B4 - 0xA2B4E4 (Pad out with FFs if there are leftover bytes until the next "Yaz0" string in Hex)






// ---- EXTRA DOCUMENTATION! THE FOLLOWING IS NOT REQUIRED FOR IMPLEMENTATION

The original Japanese ROM game has some unused icons that were supposed to replace the Ocarina item icon depending on what form Link is in. Once Link transforms, the Ocarina should change to either Guitar of Waves, Goron Drums or Deku Pipes.

Each icon was decompressed from its original .yaz0 form to .rarc by using yaz0Decompress.exe and yaz0DecompressSplit.exe by Ozidual.
The Goron Drums and Zora Guitar icons were dumped directly from a Japanese v1.0 Majora's Mask ROM.


* Goron Drums Icon:
0xAA7310 - 0xAA7B7F in MM Japanese v1.0 Decompressed ROM
* Zora Guitar Icon:
0xAA7B80 - 0xAA82AF in MM Japanese v1.0 Decompressed ROM

* The orange Deku Pipes icon was custom made by ShadowOne333 in GIMP (using the original white Deku Pipes as reference) and imported with Tile Molester. The same applies for all 3 of the custom item names.



SUBSCREEN TEXT GFX:

For the Subscreen text graphics, there's unused Japanese text graphics that can be replaced. For this specific hack, we can use the very first 3 unused Yaz0 graphics: #162, #168 and #174.

(For reference: 
#157 -> Ocarina of Time -> Dec: 0x985B4C-0x985BC3)

#162:
Dec: 0x986FD4-0x98723E (AFTER LIGHT ARROWS)

#168:
Dec: 0x9878C4-0x987A69 (AFTER MAGIC BEANS)

#172:
Dec: 0x988324-0x988570 (AFTER LENS OF TRUTH->HOOKTSHOT->GREAT FAIRY SWORD)


SUBSCREEN ICON GRAPHICS:

For the icons, in the Japanese ROM using Gameshark to get the icons brings up a blank text box (NOTE: These icons are not in the US release! They need to be ported over, they could possibly replace icons 4A, 4B, 4C, which are listed as medallions)

(For reference: 
#293 -> Ocarina of Time (Icon 00) -> Dec: 0xA36F0C
The rest of the icons are separated by "Yaz0" words in the ROM
Follow item list from: https://wiki.cloudmodding.com/mm/Item_List)

#367 (Icon 4A):
Dec: 0x9BDCAC-0x9BE514 (2153 bytes)

#368 (Icon 4B):
Dec: 0x9BE51C-0x9BED83 (2152 bytes)

#369 (Icon 4C):
Dec: 0x9BED8C-0x9BF5F5 (2154 bytes)

(NOTE: Only the guitar is below 2kB, so maybe another icon might be required to make it fit within the original space, or maybe repoint them? Drums icon is 2160 bytes, Guitar icon is 1840 bytes, Pipes icon is 2224 bytes. Possible options for the remaining ones:

After Great Fairy Sword !
After BUG! (Blue Fire bottle)
After Chateau Romani! (Hylian Loach bottle)


Bottled Blue Fire Icon 1C [321] - 2650 bytes
Bottled Hylian Loach Icon 26 [331] - 2442 bytes)



This hack *should* also repoint the text from the original Ocarina text to the new ones taken directly from Majora's Mask 3D, based on what transformation Link is currently in (Probably with some code reading the RAM address that's used for the Link transformations?)

Link forms in RAM:
0x801EF690, 0x803FFEFB
	00 = Fierce Deity Link
	01 = Goron Link
	02 = Zora Link
	03 = Deku Link
	04 = Link

Items $05, $0B, and $11 seem to be functional (with some downsides, but working). Although, from what I know, the item ID for the other instruments should remain as $00, since the game's code has checks for the Ocarina under that item ID ($00).
The game itself already has code that could be used for this very goal. It seems the "Deku Nuts" check whether or not Link is in his human form or in Deku Form, and gives different text boxes depending on his form. So this could be used for the text boxes for the Ocarina, to change them to the appropriate instrument text depending on what form Link has.

For text IDs, the whole item descriptions begin at text ID 1700. There are some entries at 170B, 1711 and 171C, but for this specific hack, text IDs $2B, $2C and $2D were used:

3E is Dungeon Map, B3 is overworld Map, 44 Fishing rod, 

TEXTS FOR INSTRUMENTS REASSIGNED TO THE FOLLOWING:
Text ID $2B: Deku Pipes (with Slingshot/Granny's Drink icon as dummy)
06 01 XX (Slingshot/Granny's Drink Icon $59 in Text Format)
Text ID $2C: Goron Drums (with Blue Fire icon as dummy)
06 01 64 (Blue Fire Icon $64 in Text Format)
Text ID $2D: Zora Guitar (with Hylian Loach icon as dummy)
06 01 70 (Hylian Loach Icon $70 in Text Format)
