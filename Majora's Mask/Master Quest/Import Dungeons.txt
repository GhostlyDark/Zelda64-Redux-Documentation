--- HOW TO EXTRACT FILES ---
1. Apply "master_quest.bps" on comrpessed Majora's Mask US Rev 0 (32 MB)
2. Decompress  the patched Master Quest ROM with Aegh (results in a 152 MB ROM)
3. Use HxD, go to the DMA Table offset and use it's value to go the offset for the .zscene of .zmap offset

--- HOW TO REPLACE IN VANILLA ROM ---
1. Use HxD, go to the DMA Table offset and use it's value to go the offset for the .zscene of .zmap offset
2. Copy the .zscene and each .zmap in their respective offsets

--- HOW THE DMA TABLE WORKS ---
DMA Table for each temple starts with the .zscene. Each DMA entry is 16 bits (one full row).
Each subsequent row is a .zmap.
If a dungeon has 13 .zmap files then you need to follow 14 rows in total (1 .zscene + 13 .zmap files)



DMA Table values have remained unchanged, so they don't have to be changed.
Only the .zscene and .zmap files got altered.

The Master Quest patch belongs to DeathBasket.
