* Implement custom code so that when Link transforms into Deku, Goron or Zora, custom icons for Guitar, Drums and Pipes replace the Ocarina of Time when transformed. 
Item icons in Subscreen, custom text boxes with the proper item descriptions + textbox item icon (different from the item icon in subscreen), and custom item name graphics are all working and replace the following items:
Slingshot ($0B), Blue Fire ($1C) and Hylian Loach ($26).
(Check "OcarinaIcons.txt" for info regarding locations and other data that could be helpful)
