* Implement custom code so that when Link transforms into Deku, Goron or Zora, custom icons for Guitar, Drums and Pipes replace the Ocarina of Time when transformed, alongside:

1) Proper description for the items taken from Majora's Mask 3D
2) Proper item icons at the Subscreen and HUD (Dpad and C-Buttons)
3) Proper item names in the Subscreen (bottom of the screen)
(Check "MMRedux.txt" under the "Ocarina custom icons" section for info regarding locations and IDs for the assets to be called)
